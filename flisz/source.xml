			<p>Some of this material was originally sourced from Wizard's of the Coast or other people.</p> 
			<p>I will try to properly annotate this source with wherever I get materials, but may miss things from time-to-time.</p> 
			<p>Thank you to everyone who worked on any of these things, you are all wonderful.</p>
